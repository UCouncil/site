							<h1>About</h1>
							<p>The GT College of Computing Undergraduate Council, or UCouncil for short,
								comprises the leaders of all CoC student organizations, and serves as 
								a forum for communication between student leaders and the Office of 
								Outreach Enrollment and Community (OEC).
							</p>
							<p> Student leaders use it as a venue to collaborate with peers and voice their 
								concern to OEC. The OEC, in turn, uses UCouncil's bi-weekly meetings to 
								communicate with student organizations.
							</p>
							<p> The OEC is the department within the College of Computing dedicated to supporting
								and growing the community of people surrounding the CoC. The office of Community,
								led by Troy Peace, is the most important part of the OEC for student organizations.
								The office of Community supports events such as homecoming, and all club activities.
								Student organizations interact with the office of Community to plan and organize 
								events, get funding and approval for club activities, and participate in activities
								organized by the OEC.
							</p>
							<p> The Corporate Affiliates Program (CAP) is another important feature of the CoC student 
								org ecosystem. The CAP program is made up of a group of companies pay the CoC
								for exlusive or prioritized recruiting privilages on campus. These funds are
								what allow the CoC to support our vibrant community of student orgs. CAP companies
								sponsor events, give tech talks, and interact with students on campus, with the 
								goal of building relationships that lead to hiring GT students. 
								When a student org needs funds, technical expertise, or would like to organize a 
								career advancement event, the CAP companies are who they reach out to. Within
								the OEC, Alicia Palmquist manages relationships with CAP companies, and is the 
								right person for student orgs to contact regarding CAP sponsorship.
