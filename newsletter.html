              <h1 class="major">CoC Orgs Weekly Documentation</h1>
              <p>Every week, the CoC Orgs Weekly newsletter is sent out to the
              CoC community with information on how to get involved in the
              community - org meetings, events, opportunities.
              This newsletter is managed by the UCouncil officers. This page
              describes how it works and how you can modify that.
              functionality.</p>

              <h3>Summer/Winter is here. How do I disable it?</h3>
              <p>Go into "CoC Orgs Newsletter Builder" and change the variable <code>SCHOOL_IN_SESSION</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>

              <h3>How does it work?</h3>
              <p>The newsletter lives in the
              <code>ucouncilgatech@gmail.com</code>'s Google Drive, in a folder
              named <code>CoC Orgs Weekly</code>. In it, there are some google
              forms, some google sheets, and a google scripts file.<br/>
              Anyone can use the forms to submit new information about their
              org's meeting for that week, big events, or opportunities for
              getting involved. Those submissions are placed in their
              respective google sheets. For instance, "New CoC Orgs Meeting"
              creates a row in "New CoC Org Meeting (Responses)". These are
              reset every week after the newsletter is sent out.<br/>
              Additionally, the "Default Org Meetings" has the default
              information for each org's weekly meetings.</p>
              <p>The google scripts code in "CoC Orgs Newsletter Builder" is
              the main code for creating the newsletter.
              It includes two triggers: one that runs the function
              <code>main_verify</code> every Sunday between 7-8pm, and one that
              runs <code>main</code> every Monday between 6-7am.<br/>
              <code>main_verify</code> will use the information in all the
              google sheets to create the newsletter and send it to the
              <code>VERIFIER_EMAIL</code>. This function will <b>not</b> modify
              any sheets files. <code>main</code> will do the same, but it'll
              send the newsletter to <code>MAILING_LIST</code> and <b>will</b>
              erase everything from the "(Responses)" sheets (but not from the
              Defaults sheet).</p>

              <h3>What's the point of the verifier email?</h3>
              <p>Because the forms are open to anyone, there can be abuse.
              It's the verifier's responsibility to check the newsletter on
              Sunday evenings to make sure nothing bad will be sent out on
              Monday mornings. This has to be someone with access to the 
              <code>ucouncilgatech@gmail.com</code> Drive, which means the
              verifier will most likely be a UCouncil officer.</p>

              <h3>What should MAILING_LIST email be?</h3>
              <p>Someone who has access to one of the CoC sympa email lists,
              like <code>cc-news-and-events</code>. Today, that person is
              Alyshia Jackson, who will receive the mailing list and forward it
              to <code>cc-news-and-events</code>. If you don't know who this
              email should be, ask OEC.</p>

              <h3>How are org meetings selected from Default/Responses sheets?</h3>
              <p>Form responses take precendence, and the form can be submitted
              multiple times. So, if an org submits the form three times, there
              will be three meetings for the org listed in the newsletter. If
              the org hasn't submitted the form, then their meetings are taken
              from the Default sheet. The order that meetings appear is
              determined by: whether the org submitted the Meetings form, and
              when they did so. Orgs that submitted the Meetings form will
              appear at the top of the list, in the same order they submitted
              the form. Orgs for all other orgs, their position in the list is
              randomized.</p>
